## Common Questions

### Why is my transaction pending?

Transactions are usually confirmed within seconds. If pending for more than a minute:
- Check Solana network status
- Verify the transaction on Solana Explorer

### Why did a transaction fail?

Common reasons:
- Insufficient USDC balance
- Insufficient SOL for fees
- Network congestion
- User rejected the transaction

### Can I refund a transaction?

Blockchain transactions are irreversible. For refunds, you need to send a separate transaction to the buyer's wallet.

<Note>
Transactions on Devnet use test USDC and have no real value.
