## Overview

PayGate supports two Solana networks:

| Network | Usage | USDC |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Devnet** | Testing and development | Test USDC (free) |
| **Mainnet** | Production | Real USDC |

## Switching Networks

### In the Dashboard

1. Log in to the [dashboard](https://paygate.getaether.xyz)
2. Find the network selector (top right)
3. Click to switch between **Devnet** and **Mainnet**

### Impact of Switching

When you change networks:

| Element | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Products | Shows only products from selected network |
| Transactions | Shows only transactions from that network |
| Statistics | Calculated based on current network |
| API Keys | Work on both networks |

## Devnet: Test Mode

### When to Use Devnet

- Test product creation
- Test payment flow
- Develop your integration
- Train your team

### Getting Devnet USDC

1. Go to [SPL Token Faucet](https://spl-token-faucet.com/)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Select USDC (Devnet)
4. Request free tokens

### Getting Devnet SOL

```bash
solana airdrop 2 YOUR_ADDRESS --url devnet
```

<Note>
Devnet USDC and SOL have no real value. They are only for testing.
</Note>

## Mainnet: Production Mode

### When to Use Mainnet

- Receive real payments
- Launch your product
- Real money transactions

### Mainnet Prerequisites

1. Wallet with SOL (for fees ~$0.00025)
2. Real USDC to test a purchase
3. Products configured on Mainnet

<Warning>
On Mainnet, payments are real and irreversible. Test on Devnet first!
</Warning>

## Creating Products by Network

### Devnet Product (Test)

```yaml
Title: My Product (Test)
Price: 0.10 USDC
Network: devnet
```

### Mainnet Product (Production)

```yaml
Title: My Product
Price: 0.10 USDC
Network: mainnet-beta
```

<Tip>
First create an identical product on Devnet to test, then create the Mainnet version.
</Tip>

## Migration Devnet → Mainnet

### Checklist

1. **Test on Devnet**
   - Product creation OK
   - Payment OK
   - Webhooks OK
   - Access OK

2. **Create on Mainnet**
   - Same configuration
   - Same price (or adjusted)
   - Same webhooks

3. **Update your links**
   - Replace Devnet product ID with Mainnet
   - Verify redirects

4. **Test with a small amount**
   - Make a real test purchase
   - Verify webhook
   - Verify access

## USDC Addresses

| Network | Mint Address |
|---------|--------------|
| Devnet | `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU` |
| Mainnet | `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` |

## API and Network

The PayGate API automatically detects the network from the product:

```typescript
// Network is determined by the product
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api-paygate.getaether.xyz/public/products/prod_xxx',
  { headers: { 'X-API-Key': apiKey } }
);

const product = await response.json();
console.log(product.network); // "devnet" or "mainnet-beta"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test on Devnet first**
2. **Keep mirror products** (Devnet and Mainnet)
3. **Use environment variables** for product IDs
4. **Document IDs** for each environment

```bash
# .env.development
PAYGATE_PRODUCT_ID=prod_devnet_xxx

# .env.production
PAYGATE_PRODUCT_ID=prod_mainnet_xxx
```
