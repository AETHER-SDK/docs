## Using an Access Token

### In an Application

The application can verify your token via the PayGate API:

```typescript
// Application side
const response = await fetch('/api/verify-access', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ accessToken: 'ft_your_token' })
});

const { valid, features } = await response.json();
```

### Copy the Token

1. Find the purchase in the list
2. Click the copy icon next to the token
3. Paste it in the application

## Filtering Purchases

### By Type

- **All** - All purchases
- **Content** - Purchased content
- **Feature Unlock** - Features
- **API Access** - API access

### By Status

- **Active** - Valid access
- **Expired** - Access ended

### By Period

- Last week
- Last month
- This year

## Verifying a Transaction

Each purchase is linked to a Solana transaction. Click the hash to see:

- On-chain confirmation
- Transaction details
- Exact timestamp
- Fees paid

## Common Issues

### "I don't see my purchase"

1. Check you're connected with the correct wallet
2. Check the network (Devnet vs Mainnet)
3. Wait a few seconds (blockchain propagation)

### "My token doesn't work"

1. Check that the token hasn't expired
2. Copy the complete token (ft_...)
3. Contact the product seller

### "Access denied"

Access may be denied if:
- The token was revoked
- The product was deactivated
- The subscription expired
