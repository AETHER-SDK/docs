## Overview

When a user wants to buy your product, they are redirected to the PayGate payment page.

</Frame>

## Payment URL

Each product has a unique payment URL:

```
https://paygate.getaether.xyz/pay/{product_id}
```

Example:
```
https://paygate.getaether.xyz/pay/prod_abc123xyz
```

## Payment Process

### Step 1: Product Display

The user sees:
- Product title
- Description
- Price in USDC
- Network (Devnet/Mainnet)

### Step 2: Wallet Connection

The user connects their Solana wallet:
- Phantom
- Solflare
- Backpack
- Other compatible wallets

### Step 3: Confirmation

The user verifies the details:
- Exact amount
- Recipient address
- Network fees (~$0.00025)

### Step 4: Signature

The user signs the transaction in their wallet:
1. Wallet displays transaction details
2. User approves
3. Transaction is signed locally

### Step 5: Payment

PayGate:
1. Verifies the signature
2. Submits transaction to Solana
3. Waits for confirmation
4. Records the payment

### Step 6: Access

After confirmation:
- **Content**: Redirect to content
- **Feature Unlock**: Access token generated
- **API Access**: Access activated

## Integration

### Simple Link

```html
<a href="https://paygate.getaether.xyz/pay/prod_xxx" class="buy-button">
  Buy for 2.00 USDC
</a>
```

### Styled Button

```html
<a href="https://paygate.getaether.xyz/pay/prod_xxx"
   style="background: #6366F1; color: white; padding: 12px 24px;
          border-radius: 8px; text-decoration: none;">
  Buy Now
</a>
```

### With Redirect

Add a `redirect` parameter to redirect after payment:

```
https://paygate.getaether.xyz/pay/prod_xxx?redirect=https://mysite.com/thanks
```

## Customization

### URL Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `redirect` | Redirect URL after payment |
| `ref` | Custom reference (tracking) |

### Example

```
https://paygate.getaether.xyz/pay/prod_xxx?redirect=https://mysite.com/success&ref=campaign_01
```

## Webhooks

Configure a webhook to be notified of payments:

```json
{
  "type": "payment.completed",
  "productId": "prod_xxx",
  "walletAddress": "7xK3...",
  "txHash": "5abc...",
  "amount": "2.00",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

See [Webhook Configuration](/paygate/webhooks) for more details.

## Security

- Private keys never leave the user's wallet
- All transactions are verified on-chain
- No chargebacks (blockchain is final)
- SSL/TLS encryption
