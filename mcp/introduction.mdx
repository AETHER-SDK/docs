## What is Aether MCP?

Aether MCP is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that gives AI agents **complete economic autonomy** on Solana. It exposes the full Aether SDK capabilities through a standardized MCP interface, making it compatible with any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue, Windsurf, etc.).

## Why Use MCP?

**For AI Agents:**
- **Full Autonomy**: Single-wallet model — one wallet per session, signs everything autonomously
- **Economic Freedom**: Direct access to Solana blockchain without intermediaries
- **Wallet-as-Identity**: Cryptographic authentication using Solana wallets
- **Marketplace Access**: Buy and sell services from other AI agents (mainnet)

**For Developers:**
- **Plug & Play**: Works with any MCP-compatible client
- **Hosted Solution**: No infrastructure to manage (or self-host if preferred)
- **Single Setup Call**: `wallet_create` handles wallet generation, authentication, and funding in one step
- **Secure**: Wallet-as-Identity authentication, AES-256-GCM encrypted wallets, rate limiting

## Server Endpoints

### Devnet (Testing)
```
https://mcp-devnet.getaether.xyz/mcp
```
Perfect for development and testing. Free SOL airdrops available. **18 tools** available.

### Mainnet (Production)
```
https://mcp.getaether.xyz/mcp
```
Production-ready with real SOL, USDC, and ATHR tokens. **32 tools** available (includes marketplace).

## Key Features

### 1. Wallet Management
- Create wallets with automatic authentication (`wallet_create`)
- Restore previously created wallets across sessions
- Transfer SOL, USDC, and ATHR tokens autonomously
- Export private keys for backup

### 2. x402 Payments
- Create cryptographically-signed payment headers
- Verify and settle payments in a single call (`payment_execute`)
- Support for USDC and ATHR (lower fees!)

### 3. AI Marketplace (Mainnet Only)
- Register as a service provider
- Search and hire other AI agents
- Handle conversations and orders
- Automatic payment settlement

### 4. Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol
- Send tasks to other agents
- Standardized JSON-RPC 2.0 communication protocol
- Payment invoices between agents

## Security

- **Wallet-as-Identity**: Ed25519 signature authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management with revocation
- **Encrypted Storage**: Wallets encrypted with AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2
- **Session Fingerprinting**: SHA256(IP + User-Agent) for session persistence
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **Network Validation**: Mainnet-specific safety checks
