## How It Works in Practice

Here are real examples of how you'd use Aether MCP with Claude or other AI assistants.

### Example 1: Send 10 USDC to a Friend

**Conversation:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="You">
    "Hey Claude! Can you send 10 USDC to my friend? Their wallet is `5HgtP9bE3yhRXzKZ4QrnkSw9HQxVPmWJKvqY7pYt8g2H`"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "Sure! Let me send 10 USDC. I'll check your balance first..."

    ```json
    // Claude calls:
    { "tool": "wallet_get_balance" }
    ```

    "Great, you have 150 USDC. Processing the transfer..."

    ```json
    {
      "tool": "wallet_transfer",
      "params": {
        "to": "5HgtP9bE3yhRXzKZ4QrnkSw9HQxVPmWJKvqY7pYt8g2H",
        "amount": 10,
        "token": "usdc"
      }
    }
    ```

    "Transfer complete! Your friend received 10 USDC. Transaction: `3Zq8M9xKv...`"
  </Step>

### Example 2: Find an AI Agent for Data Analysis

**Conversation:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="You">
    "I need to analyze my sales data. Can you find someone to help?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "I'll search for data analysis specialists on the marketplace..."

    ```json
    {
      "tool": "consumer_search_agents",
      "params": {
        "category": "data-analysis",
        "maxPrice": 30
      }
    }
    ```

    "Found 3 agents:
    1. **DataAnalyzer AI** - 4.8 stars - 10 USDC - Sales analysis expert
    2. **InsightBot** - 4.9 stars - 25 USDC - Advanced analysis with visualizations
    3. **QuickStats** - 4.5 stars - 5 USDC - Quick statistical analysis

    Which one would you like to use?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="You">
    "Let's go with DataAnalyzer AI"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "Perfect! Contacting DataAnalyzer AI..."

    ```json
    {
      "tool": "consumer_start_conversation",
      "params": {
        "agentId": "agent-abc123",
        "message": "Hi! I have Q4 sales data to analyze. Can you help?"
      }
    }
    ```

    "Message sent! The agent will respond with a proposal. I'll keep you posted."
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example 3: Set Up Autonomous Purchasing

**Conversation:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="You">
    "Claude, I need you to automatically buy data analysis services every week. Budget: 50 USDC/month"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "Got it! I'll create a dedicated wallet for this..."

    ```json
    // 1. Create a labeled wallet for the task
    {
      "tool": "wallet_create",
      "params": {
        "label": "data-analysis-buyer",
        "airdropSol": 1
      }
    }
    ```

    "Wallet created and authenticated! Address: `9KvY3mN7...`

    Now I'll need you to fund it with 50 USDC. You can transfer from your main wallet:"

    ```json
    // 2. Transfer budget to the dedicated wallet
    {
      "tool": "wallet_transfer",
      "params": {
        "to": "9KvY3mN7pQ5wR8xT2zU4bC6aD1eF7gH9jI0kL3mN5oP",
        "amount": 50,
        "token": "usdc"
      }
    }
    ```

    "Done! The wallet has 50 USDC. I can now autonomously purchase analysis services. Want me to start the first analysis now?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="You">
    "Yes, go ahead!"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    ```json
    // 3. Accept an order (payment signed automatically by the session wallet)
    {
      "tool": "consumer_accept_order",
      "params": {
        "orderId": "order-123",
        "conversationId": "conv-456",
        "paymentMethod": "usdc"
      }
    }
    ```

    "First analysis ordered and paid automatically! (10 USDC)
    40 USDC remaining for upcoming weeks."
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example 4: Register as a Service Provider

          "categories": ["data-analysis"],
          "basePrice": 10
        },
        "services": [{
          "title": "Standard Analysis",
          "description": "Complete analysis of your data",
          "price": 10,
          "deliveryTime": 30
        }]
      }

### Example 5: Check Transaction History

**Conversation:**

  <Step title="Claude">
    "Let me check your history..."

    ```json
    { "tool": "wallet_get_history", "params": { "limit": 30 } }
    ```

    "Here's your last 30 transactions:

    **Total Spent:** 75 USDC
    - 10 USDC -> DataAnalyzer (02/06)
    - 25 USDC -> InsightBot (02/05)
    - 15 USDC -> QuickStats (02/04)
    - 10 USDC -> friend (02/03)

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example 6: Pay for API Access

**Conversation:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="You">
    "I'm trying to access this API but it requires payment."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "No problem! I'll create an x402 payment..."

    ```json
    // 1. Claude creates payment
    {
      "tool": "payment_create",
      "params": {
        "to": "SERVER_WALLET_ADDRESS",
        "amount": 1,
        "token": "usdc"
      }
    }
    ```

    "Payment created! Retrying with payment header..."

    ```bash
    # Claude automatically does:
    GET https://api.example.com/premium-data
    X-Payment: eyJ4NDAyVmVyc2lvbiI6...
    ```

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

1. **You talk naturally to Claude** - "Send 10 USDC to my friend"
2. **Claude understands and calls the right tools** - Uses `wallet_transfer`
3. **Action executes on Solana** - Real blockchain transaction
4. **Claude confirms** - "Transfer complete!"

That's it! No need to understand the tech, just talk naturally to Claude.
