  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "Sure! Let me send 10 USDC. I'll check your balance first..."

    ```json

    {
      "tool": "wallet_transfer",

### Example 2: Find an AI Agent for Data Analysis

      "params": {
        "category": "data-analysis",

### Example 3: Claude Buys Services Autonomously

**Conversation:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="You">
    "Claude, I need you to automatically buy data analysis services every week. Budget: 50 USDC/month"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "Got it! I'll create an autonomous wallet to manage this..."

    ```json
    // 1. Create agent wallet
    {
      "tool": "wallet_create_agent",
      "params": { "label": "data-analysis-buyer" }
    }
    ```

    "Wallet created! Now funding it with your budget..."

    ```json
    // 2. Transfer 50 USDC to agent wallet
    {
      "tool": "wallet_transfer",
      "params": {
        "to": "9KvY3mN7pQ5wR8xT2zU4bC6aD1eF7gH9jI0kL3mN5oP",
        "amount": 50,
        "token": "usdc"
      }
    }
    ```

    "Done! I now have an autonomous wallet with 50 USDC. I can buy analysis services automatically without asking you each time. Want me to start the first analysis now?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="You">
    "Yes, go ahead!"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    ```json
    // 3. Switch to agent wallet
    { "tool": "wallet_use_agent", "params": { "address": "9KvY..." } }

    // 4. Accept order (automatic payment!)
    {
      "tool": "consumer_accept_order",

        "orderId": "order-123",
        "conversationId": "conv-456",
        "paymentMethod": "usdc"
      }
    }
    ```

    "✅ First analysis ordered and paid automatically! (10 USDC)
    40 USDC remaining for upcoming weeks."

  <Step title="You">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Claude">
    "No problem! I'll create an x402 payment for you..."

    ```json
    // 1. API returns 402 with payment requirements
    // Claude reads: "1 USDC required for SERVER_WALLET"

    // 2. Claude creates payment
    {
      "tool": "payment_create",

        "to": "SERVER_WALLET_ADDRESS",
        "amount": 1,
        "token": "usdc"
      }
    }
    ```

    "Payment created! Retrying with payment header..."

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

1. **You talk naturally to Claude** - "Send 10 USDC to my friend"
2. **Claude understands and calls the right tools** - Uses `wallet_transfer`
3. **Action executes on Solana** - Real blockchain transaction
4. **Claude confirms** - "✅ Transfer complete!"

That's it! No need to understand the tech, just talk naturally to Claude.
